	<h2>CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
    <hr />

    <div class="box">
        <div class="box-content">
            <p>PyData US is a community conference intended for networking and
            collaboration in the developer community.</p>
            
            <p>We value the participation of each member of the Python community and
            want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly,
            all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees
            throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially
            sponsored by PyData or not.</p>
            
            <p>To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and
            volunteers at any PyData event are required to conform to the following Code
            of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
            
            <h3>The Shorter Version</h3>
            
            <p>PyData is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
            for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
            appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
            conference participants in any form.</p>
            
            <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
            including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
            imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.</p>
            
            <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
            professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary
            jokes are not appropriate for PyData.</p>
            
            <p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without
            a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
            
            <h3>The Longer Version</h3>
            
            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
            orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
            images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
            photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
            inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
            
            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
            immediately.</p>
            
            <p>Sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-
            harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images,
            activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
            sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
            environment.</p>
            
            <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and
            other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive
            swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for PyData.</p>
            
            <p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the
            conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
            warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
