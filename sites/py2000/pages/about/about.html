        <h3>Conference Mission</h3>
        <p>PyData is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis tools
        in Python.  The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a place to
        share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply our
        language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of
        data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.</p>
        <p>We aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with
        tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners,
        and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in person.</p>
        <p>A major goal of the conference is to provide a venue for users across
        all the various domains of data analysis to share their experiences
        and their techniques, as well as highlight the triumphs and potential
        pitfalls of using Python for certain kinds of problems.</p>
        <p>We invite all conference participants to showcase how they have used
        Python to solve their problems, by submitting a Showcase/Expo
        Proposal.  These short, 15-minute presentations should help stimulate
        ideas and questions from other participants, tackling similar problems
        in other domains.</p>
        
        <h3>History</h3>
        
        <p>The first <a href="http://pydataworkshop.eventbrite.com/" title="PyData Workshop">PyData Workshop</a> was held in
        March of 2012, at the Googleplex in Mountain View, CA.  Many prominent
        individuals in the Python data &amp; scientific computing community were
        on-hand to deliver tutorials and how-to presentations, and the
        Workshop (and a Friday night hack-a-thon) were a great success.
        Unfortunately, we had a very limited amount of space, and were
        unable to provide a spot for everyone who wanted to
        come.</p>
        <p>In light of the demand and the success of that event, we
        reserved a much larger venue for PyData NYC.  The conference sold out
        and was a great success. </p>
        <p>&quot;It was so successful that even Hurricane Sandy 
        tried to attend!&quot;</p>
        
        <p>
        In order to continue the growth of PyData we need to continue to charge a modest
        attendence fee to cover the costs of the venue and food and beverage service.
        It also means that we have a greater need for
          <a href="/sv2013/sponsor/apply">commercial sponsors</a>, so please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@pydata.org">admin@pydata.org</a> if you want to
        have your company highlighted in front of hundreds of data science &amp;
        data analysis Pythonistas!</p>
