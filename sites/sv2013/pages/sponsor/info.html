            <p>PyData is a community-oriented conference that offers great talks from luminaries in the community, and attracts very talented hackers from diverse backgrounds
                Whether you are hiring, selling, or just promoting your brand, it's a great opportunity to showcase your company in a more intimate setting than larger conferences with thousands of attendees and hundreds of sponsors.</p>
            <p>Sponsors are vital to the success of PyData. Your support allows us to keep ticket prices low, provide first rate facilities, sponsor student attendees, and provide video recordings of all sessions.  Sponsorship includes a specified number of passes depending on your sponsorship level, your logo and description on the PyData website, physical banners at the conference, and any other approved promotional material you wish to display and distribute.</p>
