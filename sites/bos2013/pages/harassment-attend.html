<h2>ATTENDEE PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING HARASSMENT</h2>
<div class="box">
    <div class="box-content">
        <p>This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide
        titled <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">
        "Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports”</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Keep in mind that all conference staff will be wearing a conference t-shirt/
        button with the word “STAFF” on it (or otherwise clearly marked as
        staff). The staff will also be prepared to handle the incident. All of our
        staff are informed of the code of conduct policy and guide for handling
        harassment at the conference. There will be a mandatory staff meeting
        onsite at the conference when this will be reiterated as well.</p>
        
        <p>Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a conference staff
        member - all reports are confidential.
        When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as
        available, but do not interview people about the incident - Staff will assist you
        in writing the report/collecting information.</p>
        
        <p>The important information consists of:</p>
        <ul class="">
        <li>Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant doing the
        harassing</li>
        <li>The behavior that was in violation</li>
        <li>The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report
        was made)</li>
        <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
        <li>Other people involved in the incident</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The staff is well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further
        proceed with the situation.</p>
        
        <p>If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security
        only at a victim's request. If you do feel your safety in jeopardy please
        do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement by dialing 911. If you
        do not have a cell phone, you can use any hotel phone or simply ask a
        staff member.</p>
        
        <p>If the matter is especially urgent, please call/contact any of these individuals:</p>
        
        <li>Leah Silen (event organizer) at +1 (972) 896-3688</li>
