<h3>What is PyData?</h3>
<p>PyData.org is the home for all things related to the use of Python in data 
management and analysis. This site aims to make open source data science tools easily accessible by listing the links in one location. If you would like to submit a download link or any items to be listed in PyData News, please let us know at: <a href="mailto:admin@pydata.org">admin@pydata.org</a>

<h3>Conferences</h3>

<p>
PyData conferences are a gathering of users and developers of data 
analysis tools in Python. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts 
a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to 
apply the language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast 
realm of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
</p>

<p>
We aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with tutorials 
for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners, and oppor-
tunities for package developers and users to meet in person.
</p>

<p>
A major goal of PyData events and conferences is to provide a venue for 
users across all the various domains of data analysis to share their ex-
periences and their techniques, as well as highlight the triumphs and 
potential pitfalls of using Python for certain kinds of problems.
</p>

<p>
PyData is organized by <a href="numfocus.org">NumFOCUS</a> with the generous help and support 
of our sponsors. Proceeds from PyData are donated to NumFOCUS and 
used for the continued development of the open-source tools used by data 
scientists If you would like to volunteer to be a part of the PyData team
